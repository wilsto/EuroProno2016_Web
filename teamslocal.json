He is, however, fourth choice going into the tourplayernt behind Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Marcus Berg and John Guidetti. A muslim, he started to take his faith even more seriously after a childhood friend died. “It is easy to forget ‘death’ and think that things will be ok and work for ever, he told nt.se. “But that is not the way it works. When I stood there at the funeral and looked around I was reminded that the dead body was a close friend, someone I had grown up with. We saw each other pretty much every day, played football together. I have been a muslim all the time but I didn’t start practising until lately. I feel a different calm in my life now. It is good for the soul. The meaning of life and death has become clearer, it feels as if I have got answers to those questions.”",
